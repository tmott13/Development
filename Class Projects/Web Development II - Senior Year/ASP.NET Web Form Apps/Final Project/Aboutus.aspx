        &nbsp;<strong>Who Are We?</strong></h1>
    NatureCare is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that 
    provides cleaning, preservation, education, and 
    security services for the Florida Everglades. We provide our services with the 
    help of our wonderful volunteer team, donations, and partnerships with
    <a href="http://www.nps.gov/ever/index.htm">Everglades National Park</a>,
    <a href="http://www.evergladesplan.org/">The Comprehensive Everglades 
    Restoration Plan</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/wild-places/everglades.aspx">National 
    Wildlife Federation</a>.&nbsp;
    <br />
    <br />
    NatureCare initially formed in 2003 as a 10-member interest-group, but NC 
    quickly became interested in making an impact by helping to protect the beauty, 
    serenity, and natural ecosystem of the Everglades. Within 10 years, NatureCare 
    has grown to 6,000 members who have contributed over 50,000 hours and raised 
    $1.7 million for the preservation of the Everglades.<br />
    <h1>
        Our Mission</h1>
    <p>
        NatureCare&#39;s mission is to restore, protect, and celebrate mother nature. 
        Whether preservation is being done to the Everglades or another natural 
        phenomemon in the world, it is important to us that we value our natural 
        resources and encourage future generations to do the same.</p>
